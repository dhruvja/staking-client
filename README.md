# Getting Started with Staking Client

There are a couple of jobs and applications defined already. The creation of job and application can only be done by the admin. But some of the jobs and applications are already initialized, so you can start staking on them.

Note: The buttons which are in grey color are functions which can only be called by the admin. So unless u have the admin wallet, those buttons wont work.

## How to use

- Click on the application Id ( the one in blue) to start staking.
- There is a mint button where u can mint tokens by specifying the value.
- After minting tokens, u can start staking by specifying the amount of tokens to stake and clicking the stake button.
- Voila, you have successfully staked on the application.
